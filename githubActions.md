# CI/CD and GitHub Actions

## What is CI (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery)?

**Continuous Integration (CI)** is the practice of automatically building, testing, and merging code changes from multiple developers into a central repository.

**Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)** is the practice of automatically deploying (or delivering) the changes that have passed the CI process to a staging or production environment.

Benefits of CI/CD:
- Early detection of issues
- Faster release cycles
- Increased collaboration

## What is a CI/CD Pipeline?

A CI/CD pipeline is a series of automated steps that handle the entire software delivery process, from code changes to deployment. Here's a typical pipeline:

```
Code Commit → Build → Test → Code Analysis → Security Scanning → Packaging → Deployment → Monitoring
```

Pipelines ensure consistent and reliable software delivery by enforcing quality checks and automation.

## What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a powerful CI/CD platform provided by GitHub, allowing you to automate software workflows directly in your GitHub repository. It enables you to build, test, and deploy your code using customizable workflows defined in YAML files.

Benefits of GitHub Actions:
- Integration with GitHub
- Extensive workflow templates
- Vibrant ecosystem of community-created actions

## Developer Workflow Cases and Examples

### Collaborative Development

Multiple developers working on the same codebase, using pull requests, code reviews, and automated testing to ensure code quality.

```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow for collaborative development
name: Collaborative Development

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
```

This workflow runs whenever a pull request is opened or updated against the `main` branch. It checks out the code, installs dependencies, and runs tests.

### Feature Branch Workflow

Developers create separate branches for new features, which are merged into the main branch after code review and testing.

### Trunk-Based Development

Developers commit small, incremental changes directly to the main branch, relying heavily on CI/CD to catch issues early.

### Release Workflows

Automated processes for creating release candidates, generating changelogs, and publishing releases.

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Setting up CI/CD workflows in GitHub Actions using YAML files:

```yaml
# Simple CI workflow
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
```

This workflow is triggered on every push to the `main` branch. It sets up Node.js, installs dependencies, and runs tests.

## Basic Concepts of GitHub Events, Actions, and Examples

**GitHub Events**: Triggers that initiate a workflow (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`, `release`, `schedule`).

**GitHub Actions**: Reusable building blocks that perform specific tasks within a workflow (e.g., checking out code, running tests, building Docker images).

Examples:
- Linting code
- Running unit tests
- Building and deploying applications
- Publishing packages
- Sending notifications

## Syntax of GitHub Actions Workflows

### Anatomy of a GitHub Actions Workflow File (YAML)

```yaml
name: Workflow Name

on:
  # List of events that trigger the workflow

jobs:
  job_id:
    name: Job Name
    runs-on: runner-environment
    steps:
      - name: Step Name
        uses: action/name@version
        with:
          # Action inputs
      - run: |
          # Shell commands
        env:
          # Environment variables
```

- Defining jobs, steps, and actions
- Using environment variables, secrets, and contexts
- Conditional execution and expression syntax
- Sharing data between jobs using artifacts and caching
- Scheduling and manually triggering workflows

## Advanced Topics

- Securing GitHub Actions workflows (e.g., encrypted secrets, code scanning, dependency review)
- Scaling and optimizing workflows (e.g., matrix builds, caching, self-hosted runners)
- Monitoring and reporting on workflow runs (e.g., notifications, status badges, workflow artifacts)
- Migrating existing CI/CD pipelines to GitHub Actions
- Best practices for writing maintainable and reusable workflows
